    In philosophy, a sound conclusion follows logically from well-examined premises. The same
    principle applies when choosing tools for building web apps. If we default to trendy frameworks
    without first understanding the problem, we should be skeptical that we've made the right
    choice. Having said that, I built this site using Astro; no JS on the browser but arguably
    overkill on the backend tooling!
