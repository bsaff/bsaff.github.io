      My name is Benjamin Saff. I'm a software engineer based in Philadelphia. I like it here. I'm never more than a short bike ride away from <a href="https://www.paradigmarts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">art</a>, <a href='https://utphilly.com/events/' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">music</a>, <a href="http://royalsushiandizakaya.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">restaurants</a>, and nature. I enjoy reading books, playing guitar, and ocassionally writing, too. My friends, family, and partner are most important to me. If you are a bookworm too, let's be friends on <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23506884-ben-saff' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Goodreads</a>.

      I built this site using Vue. I don't use Vue normally but I wanted to try it out. I don't really like it so far üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
